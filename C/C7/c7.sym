# The fold is the number of times that the volume can be rotated along
# the symmetry axis giving the same view from different view points.
# the structure for the rotational axis is
# rot_axis      <fold> <X0> <Y0> <Z0>
# mirror_plane         <X0> <Y0> <Z0>
# P4212

# The following line is a 7-fold rotational symmetry axis along Z-axis.
